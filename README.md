This is a simple project I wrote today. I took this page:
https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE/blob/main/top_200_tags.json
and organized the data, cut out the redundancies, eliminated the Asian entries, and wrote a script where you can generate a prompt with the data easily.

You will need to download Autoit to either run the script or compile it. Or you can trust my compiled executable. It is clean, but you should always be wary of executables from strangers. My site is called AutoItProjects, so most everything I make will be in that language.

How to use: simply click every keyword or phrase you want to include in your prompt. Then click the Go! button and the prompt is created and simultaneously copied to your clipboard. 

This is my first project on GitHub, so I'm not a professional. 

Hope you enjoy!
